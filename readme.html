  <h1>Authentication</h1>
  <body>This app is configured to authenticate with Username and Password of a Brinqa account with GraphQL access.</body>
  <h2>Setup</h2>
  <body>The GraphQL console may be off by default in the UI, meaning that there is no way to access it without a direct link.
    In order to create a link under an icon, navigate to Navigation Menu under User Interface, edit the source code there,
    and include this block under the icon you wish to access the console through.</body>
    <code>
      <br>{<br>
      "link": {<br>
        "type": "URI",<br>
        "href": "/graphql/{appName}/browser",<br>
        "target": "_blank"<br>
      },<br>
      "title": "GraphQL Console",<br>
      "visibility": {<br>
        "active": true,<br>
        "roles": [<br>
          *Insert roles able to access the console here*<br>
        ]<br>
      }<br>
    }<br>
  </code>
  <h3>Overview of Usage</h3>
  <body>The query in this app is a query against the GraphQL console. There are two direct usages, the first is to put in
    a singular model name (ie: Asset) to return the attributes that exist under that model. Otherwise, a pluralized version
    of the model is used (ie: assets, note case sensitivity) in conjunction with a filter string (ie: name = *assetName*)
    and a list of return values, space delineated (ie: ip id name risk) to return information, in the case of the example,
    on an asset with a specific name
